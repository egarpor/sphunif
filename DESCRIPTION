Description: Implementation of uniformity tests on the circle and
    (hyper)sphere. The main function of the package is unif_test(), which
    conveniently collects more than 30 tests for assessing uniformity on
    S^{p-1}={x in R^p : ||x||=1}, p >= 2. The test statistics are implemented
    in the unif_stat function, which allows to compute several statistics to
    several samples within a single call, facilitating thus Monte Carlo
    experiments. Furthermore, the unif_stat_MC() function allows to
    parallelize them in a simple way. The asymptotic null distributions of
    the statistics are available through the function unif_stat_distr(). The
    core of the sphunif is coded in C++ by relying on the 'Rcpp' package.
    The package allows the replication of the data application in
    García-Portugués, Navarro-Esteban and Cuesta-Albertos (2020) <arXiv:2008.09897>.
