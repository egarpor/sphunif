Description: Implementation of uniformity tests on the circle and
    (hyper)sphere. The main function of the package is unif_test(), which
    conveniently collects more than 30 tests for assessing uniformity on
    S^{p-1}={x in R^p : ||x||=1}, p >= 2. The test statistics are implemented
    in the unif_stat() function, which allows computing several statistics to
    several samples within a single call, thus facilitating Monte Carlo
    experiments. Furthermore, the unif_stat_MC() function allows
    parallelizing them in a simple way. The asymptotic null distributions of
    the statistics are available through the function unif_stat_distr(). The
    core of 'sphunif' is coded in C++ by relying on the 'Rcpp' package.
    The package also provides several novel datasets and gives the
    replicability for the data application in García-Portugués,
    Navarro-Esteban and Cuesta-Albertos (2023) <arXiv:2008.09897>.
