* This is a new release.
* "Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION" -> Double-checked, they are correctly spelled.
* "Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs" -> Double-checked, they are correctly spelled.
* Observe that the use of `set.seed` in `unif_stat_MC` and `int_sph_MC` serves the purpose of reproducibility and debugging when running simulations in parallel. Since the default is *not* to set any seeds (`seeds = NULL`), unless the user explicitly demands otherwise, the package is compliant with the policy "Packages should not modify the global environment (userâ€™s workspace)."
