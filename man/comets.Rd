\description{
Comet orbits data from the
\href{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_query.html}{
JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine}. The normal vector of a comet orbit
represents is a vector on \eqn{S^2}.
}
\details{
The normal vector to the ecliptic plane of the comet with inclination
\eqn{i} and longitude of the ascending node \eqn{\omega} is
\deqn{(\sin(i) \sin(\omega), -\sin(i) \cos(\omega), \cos(i))'.}{
(sin(i) sin(\omega), -sin(i) cos(\omega), cos(i))'.}

A prograde comet has positive \eqn{\cos(i)}{cos(i)}, negative
\eqn{\cos(i)}{cos(i)} represents a retrograde comet.

\code{class} has the following levels:
\itemize{
 \item \code{COM}: comet orbit not matching any defined orbit class.
 \item \code{CTc}: Chiron-type comet, as defined by Levison and Duncan
 (T_Jupiter > 3; a > a_Jupiter).
 \item \code{ETc}: Encke-type comet, as defined by Levison and Duncan
 (T_Jupiter > 3; a < a_Jupiter).
 \item \code{HTC}: Halley-type comet, classical definition (20y < P < 200y).
 \item \code{HYP}: comets on hyperbolic orbits.
 \item \code{JFc}: Jupiter-family comet, as defined by Levison and Duncan
 (2 < T_Jupiter < 3).
 \item \code{JFC}: Jupiter-family comet, classical definition (P < 20y).
 \item \code{PAR}: comets on parabolic orbits.
}
Hyperbolic and parabolic comets are not periodic; only elliptical comets
are periodic.

The \code{ccf09} variable gives the observations considered in
Cuesta-Albertos et al. (2009) after fetching in the database in 2007-12-14
for the comets such that \code{!(class \%in\% c("HYP", "PAR")) & per_y >= 200}.
Due to the dynamic nature of the data, more comets were added to the
database since 2007 and also some past records were updated.

The script performing the data preprocessing is available at
\href{https://github.com/egarpor/sphunif/blob/master/data-raw/comets.R}{
\code{comets.R}}. The data was retrieved on 2022-05-28. A previous version
of this dataset based on the old NASA's JPL Database (accessed on
2020-05-07) is available at
\href{https://github.com/egarpor/sphunif/blob/master/data-raw/comets-old.rda}{
\code{comets-old.rda}} and was obtained with
\href{https://github.com/egarpor/sphunif/blob/master/data-raw/comets-old.R}{
